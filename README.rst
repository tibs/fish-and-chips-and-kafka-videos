Videos of the demos for Fish and Chips and Apache KafkaÂ®
========================================================

These are the demo videos I am using for the talk at
https://github.com/tibs/fish-and-chips-and-kafka-talk

I've made a separate repository because you don't necessarily
want to download videos when you're looking at the main repository.
